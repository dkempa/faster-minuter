wt_fbb - Wavelet tree based on a fixed block boosting technique
===============================================================


Description
-----------

This package contains implementation of the wavelet tree data
structure using the fixed block boosting (FBB) technique. The
data structure is described in the paper

  Simon Gog, Juha Kärkkäinen, Dominik Kempa, Matthias Petri, Simon
  J. Puglisi: Faster, Minuter.
  In Proc. 2016 Data Compression Conference (DCC), 2016.

The latest version of wt_fbb is available from
https://github.com/dkempa/faster-minuter.



Usage
-----

wt_fbb is implemented as a plugin into the sdsl library
(https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite). The current version has been
tested on Linux/PC.

The class comes with default parameters chosen for good overall
performance and in nearly all practical scenarios should be used as
is. The key customization of the class is in plugging in different
bitvector implementations. The default is the hybrid bitvector, but
faster (and larger) alternatives are available in the sdsl library.
Refer to the paper above for details and experimental comparisons.




Terms of use
------------

wt_fbb is released under the MIT/X11 license. See the file LICENCE for
more details.
